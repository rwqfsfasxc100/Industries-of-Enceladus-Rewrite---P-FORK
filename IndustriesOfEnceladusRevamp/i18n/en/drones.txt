SYSTEM_DND_HARVTUG|OT Hard-Stop Tug Drones

SYSTEM_DND_HARVTUG_DESC|The Obonto-Titan Hard-Stop nanodrone delivery system is a modification of THI's Harvester-class system, configured to bring high-albedo objects to a gentle stop relative to the rings. Originally manufactured for the OCP-209 as a proprietary equipment loss method, it has since seen distribution on the aftermarket following commerce agreements in the 2260s.

SYSTEM_DND_HARVHAUL|THI Harvester-class Haul Drones

SYSTEM_DND_HARVHAUL_DESC|This monstrous piece of hardware is an industrial assembly line masquerading as a disposable nanodrone assembler. Its enormous infrared laser array and fabrication unit have be connected to individual low-stress buses, but when it has enough power, it's a thing to behold. The unit's behaviour guides drones to intercept any high-albedo objects and tows them towards your ship.

SYSTEM_EXODYN|THI Dyna-Cargo Container

SYSTEM_EXODYN_DESC|An experimental dynamic variant of the THI Cargo Container, released to the public in the mid-2200s. Requires on-site mineral processing units to utilise. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nDyna-Cargo is a trademark of Titan Heavy Industries. All rights reserved. Station control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor. Captains assume all such liability.

SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT|THI Cargo Container (Alternate)

SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries Cargo Containers are fully autonomous storage pods that can relay processed minerals from a mining site. When the cradle is powered down, the pod will return to the designated station. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor. Captains assume all such liability. \n\nThis alternate version for the Prospector series is placed at the midships for enhanced manoeuvring.


SYSTEM_EXMONO_ALT|THI Monocargo Container (Alternate)

SYSTEM_EXMONO_ALT_DESC|A single-ore variant of the standard THI Cargo Container for specialized mining runs that focus on the collection of only one mineral type. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor. Captains assume all such liability. \n\nThis alternate version for the Prospector series is placed at the midships for enhanced manoeuvring.
