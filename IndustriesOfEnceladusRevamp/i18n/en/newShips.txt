SHIP_YME|Y-ME Fission Retrofit

SHIP_YME_SPECS|Make: Angry Ex-Eon Interstellar Employees\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 1\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 5\nDry mass: 34,500 kg \nCargo bay: 140 m^3 \nProcessed cargo storage (per mineral): 11,000 kg

SHIP_YME_DESC|This ship was created by several annoyed employees of Eon Interstellar who split off due to how the company mismanaged both it's employees and PR. They banded together to create a more economically viable vessel, making the shining hull of the EIME more accessible to those outside of very well to do positions. \n\nDue to the nature of the EIME's original hull, a custom liquid-drum reactor had to be put in place, something many end-users wanted with the original vessel. An older reactor left over from K37s being decommissioned for Enceladus Prime's habitat constructions was used for the retrofit, being in common supply.

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE|OCP-209 Salvaged Hull

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE_SPECS|Make: Obonto Microengineering\nBay-Fitted Manipulator Arms: 1\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 8\nDry mass: 184,500 kg\nCargo bay: yes\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 50,000 kg

SHIP_OCP-SALVAGE_DESC|This ship was found in a back alley behind Sin Space Engineering. We asked if we could take it and the (unpaid) intern working the atrium said he didn't care so we did. The entire bay has been cut out and replaced with a manipulator arm, we believe partially to make a competitor to the MAD-CERF, and partially because Sin Space Engineering didn't know what to do with the rest of the OCP after making their OK720 line of ships.

SHIP_CK65|CK-65

SHIP_CK65_SPECS|Make: Conlindo / Rusatom-Antonoff\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDrone Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 12\nDry mass: 44,500 kg \nCargo bay: 40 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (per mineral): 108,000 kg

SHIP_CK65_DESC|The rise of mineral processors gave a need for ships that could carry significant quantities of it for interplanetary travel. The century-old venture of the Cothon class of ships showed the viability of automated ships to be used for travel, and the Eagles were chosen as the ship of choice to complete the new venture. A large portion of it's cargo bay was gutted to fit 6 ginormous bays to store processed cargo, alongside a luxury living quarter space to house 12 passengers. A large portion of the Eagle's hardware was left in for the convenience of captains, however the grinder was replaced with a standard excavator to ensure a more reliable experience.

SHIP_CK69|CK-69

SHIP_CK69_SPECS|Make: Conlindo / Rusatom-Antonoff\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDrone Hardpoints: 2\nCrew: 12\nDry mass: 44,500 kg \nCargo bay: 40 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage (combined): 576,000 kg

SHIP_CK69_DESC|The success of the CK-65 led to a more advanced CK-69 to handle any quantity of ore, at the cost of a slightly lower total hold. It saw its use during dips in throughput at Enceladus, where space would be wasted on a stock CK-65 due to the lack of a specific mineral, however was very popular among miners who could bring back large quantities of ore more reliably.
