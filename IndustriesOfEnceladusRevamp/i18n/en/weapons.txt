SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM|RA DMW Cannon

SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM_DESC|Rusatom-Antonoff's Directed Microwave Cannon utilises a long, tubular waveguide to concentrate microwaves into a tight beam of irradiance. Its modular and unspecialised components are cheap and quick to repair, but are offset by high installation costs and middling power efficiency.

SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM_SPECS|Effective range: 800 m \nPower consumption: 120 MW \nOutput power: 90 MW \nWavelength: 1 cm \nMass: 400 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff


SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM_PDT|RA DMW Cannon Turret

SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM_PDT_DESC|This version of the Rusatom-Antonoff DMW Cannon is mounted onto a Nakamura Dynamics NDPT turret body. It enjoys similar handling characteristics and the adjustable configuration parameters of their 42xx line of point-defense railgun turrets, though its gimbal driver had to be downgeared to properly manage the unit's heavy AC cabling. \n\nThe DMW-CT can automatically acquire and track targets, but, unlike its railgun counterpart, does not require manual input to fire.

SYSTEM_MWTIGHTBEAM_PDT_SPECS|Effective range: 2000 m \n Targeting AI: Class-1 \nPower consumption: 120 MW \nOutput power: 90 MW \nWavelength: 1 cm \nMass: 3,000 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom

SYSTEM_PDTL|NDCL-80 Point Defence Laser Turret

SYSTEM_PDTL_MANUAL|Automatically picks targets.\nFires automatically.\nCoordinates across multiple systems.\nTargeting computer is imperfect.\nDisable the hardpoint to prevent accidental friendly fire.\nDeals thermal damage.

SYSTEM_PDTL_DESC|A small laser attached to a turret base allows for a wide coverage from the hardpoint's point of view. The lower power makes for a bit of extra work on the laser to break rocks, however it prevents as much damage dealt to targets. It fires automatically, so users are warned to have proper control over their governing IFF systems to prevent unwanted conflict. \n\nTHE HARDWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
